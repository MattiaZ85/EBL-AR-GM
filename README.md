This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the algorithm proposed in the report.

Mattia Zorzi, "Empirical Bayesian learning in AR graphical models", Automatica, Volume 109, 108516, 2019.

This implementation is due to Mattia Zorzi zorzimat@dei.unipd.it .

The implementation is a research prototype still in development and is provided AS IS. No warranties or guarantees of any kind are given. Do not distribute this code or use it other than for your own research without permission of the authors.

Feedback is greatly appreciated.

Installation: Run "main.m" to understand how the function are used; "identS.m" is the function to estimate a sparse graphical model; "identSL.m" is the function to estimate a latent-variable graphical model.
